# Large Applications as Packages

Imagine a simple flask application structure that looks like this:

```
/yourapplication
    yourapplication.py
    /static
        style.css
    /templates
        layout.html
        index.html
        login.html
        ...
```
While this is fine for small applications, for larger applications it’s a good idea to use a package instead of a module. The Tutorial is structured to use the package pattern, see the example code.

## Simple Packages

To convert that into a larger one, just create a new folder
`yourapplication` inside the existing one and move everything below it.
Then rename `yourapplication.py` to `__init__.py`.  (Make sure to delete
all `.pyc` files first, otherwise things would most likely break)

You should then end up with something like that:

```
/yourapplication
    /yourapplication
        __init__.py
        /static
            style.css
        /templates
            layout.html
            index.html
            login.html
            ...
```
But how do you run your application now?  The naive ```
python
yourapplication/__init__.py
```
 will not work.  Let’s just say that Python
does not want modules in packages to be the startup file.  But that is not
a big problem, just add a new file called `pyproject.toml` next to the inner
`yourapplication` folder with the following contents:

```
[project]
name = "yourapplication"
dependencies = [
    "flask",
]
[build-system]
requires = ["flit_core<4"]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"
```
Install your application so it is importable:

```
$ pip install -e .
```
To use the `flask` command and run your application you need to set
the `--app` option that tells Flask where to find the application
instance:

```
$ flask --app yourapplication run
```
What did we gain from this? Now we can restructure the application a bit into multiple modules. The only thing you have to remember is the following quick checklist:

- the - `Flask`application object creation has to be in the- `__init__.py`file. That way each module can import it safely and the- `__name__`variable will resolve to the correct package.
- all the view functions (the ones with a - `route()`decorator on top) have to be imported in the- `__init__.py`file. Not the object itself, but the module it is in. Import the view module- **after the application object is created**.

Here’s an example `__init__.py`:

```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
import yourapplication.views
```
And this is what `views.py` would look like:

```
from yourapplication import app
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello World!'
```
You should then end up with something like that:

```
/yourapplication
    pyproject.toml
    /yourapplication
        __init__.py
        views.py
        /static
            style.css
        /templates
            layout.html
            index.html
            login.html
            ...
```
Circular Imports

Every Python programmer hates them, and yet we just added some:
circular imports (That’s when two modules depend on each other.  In this
case `views.py` depends on `__init__.py`).  Be advised that this is a
bad idea in general but here it is actually fine.  The reason for this is
that we are not actually using the views in `__init__.py` and just
ensuring the module is imported and we are doing that at the bottom of
the file.

## Working with Blueprints

If you have larger applications it’s recommended to divide them into smaller groups where each group is implemented with the help of a blueprint. For a gentle introduction into this topic refer to the Modular Applications with Blueprints chapter of the documentation.
