# Templates

Flask leverages Jinja as its template engine. You are obviously free to use a different template engine, but you still have to install Jinja to run Flask itself. This requirement is necessary to enable rich extensions. An extension can depend on Jinja being present.

This section only gives a very quick introduction into how Jinja
is integrated into Flask.  If you want information on the template
engine’s syntax itself, head over to the official [Jinja Template
Documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) for
more information.

## Jinja Setup

Unless customized, Jinja is configured by Flask as follows:

- autoescaping is enabled for all templates ending in - `.html`,- `.htm`,- `.xml`,- `.xhtml`, as well as- `.svg`when using- `render_template()`.
- autoescaping is enabled for all strings when using - `render_template_string()`.
- a template has the ability to opt in/out autoescaping with the - `{% autoescape %}`tag.
- Flask inserts a couple of global functions and helpers into the Jinja context, additionally to the values that are present by default. 

## Standard Context

The following global variables are available within Jinja templates by default:

- config
- The current configuration object ( - `flask.Flask.config`- ## Changelog- Changed in version 0.10: This is now always available, even in imported templates. - Added in version 0.6. 

- request
- The current request object ( - `flask.request`

- session
- The current session object ( - `flask.session`

- g
- The request-bound object for global variables ( - `flask.g`

- url_for()
- The - `flask.url_for()`

- get_flashed_messages()
- The - `flask.get_flashed_messages()`

The Jinja Context Behavior

These variables are added to the context of variables, they are not global variables. The difference is that by default these will not show up in the context of imported templates. This is partially caused by performance considerations, partially to keep things explicit.

What does this mean for you? If you have a macro you want to import, that needs to access the request object you have two possibilities:

- you explicitly pass the request to the macro as parameter, or the attribute of the request object you are interested in. 
- you import the macro “with context”. 

Importing with context looks like this:

```
{% from '_helpers.html' import my_macro with context %}
```
## Controlling Autoescaping

Autoescaping is the concept of automatically escaping special characters
for you.  Special characters in the sense of HTML (or XML, and thus XHTML)
are `&`, `>`, `<`, `"` as well as `'`.  Because these characters
carry specific meanings in documents on their own you have to replace them
by so called “entities” if you want to use them for text.  Not doing so
would not only cause user frustration by the inability to use these
characters in text, but can also lead to security problems.  (see
[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](../web-security/#security-xss))

Sometimes however you will need to disable autoescaping in templates. This can be the case if you want to explicitly inject HTML into pages, for example if they come from a system that generates secure HTML like a markdown to HTML converter.

There are three ways to accomplish that:

- In the Python code, wrap the HTML string in a - `Markup`object before passing it to the template. This is in general the recommended way.
- Inside the template, use the - `|safe`filter to explicitly mark a string as safe HTML (- `{{ myvariable|safe }}`)
- Temporarily disable the autoescape system altogether. 

To disable the autoescape system in templates, you can use the ```
{%
autoescape %}
```
 block:

```
{% autoescape false %}
    <p>autoescaping is disabled here
    <p>{{ will_not_be_escaped }}
{% endautoescape %}
```
Whenever you do this, please be very cautious about the variables you are using in this block.

## Registering Filters

If you want to register your own filters in Jinja you have two ways to do
that.  You can either put them by hand into the
[ jinja_env](../api/#flask.Flask.jinja_env) of the application or use the

[decorator.](../api/#flask.Flask.template_filter)

`template_filter()`The two following examples work the same and both reverse an object:

```
@app.template_filter('reverse')
def reverse_filter(s):
    return s[::-1]
def reverse_filter(s):
    return s[::-1]
app.jinja_env.filters['reverse'] = reverse_filter
```
In case of the decorator the argument is optional if you want to use the
function name as name of the filter.  Once registered, you can use the filter
in your templates in the same way as Jinja’s builtin filters, for example if
you have a Python list in context called `mylist`:

```
{% for x in mylist | reverse %}
{% endfor %}
```
## Context Processors

To inject new variables automatically into the context of a template, context processors exist in Flask. Context processors run before the template is rendered and have the ability to inject new values into the template context. A context processor is a function that returns a dictionary. The keys and values of this dictionary are then merged with the template context, for all templates in the app:

```
@app.context_processor
def inject_user():
    return dict(user=g.user)
```
The context processor above makes a variable called `user` available in
the template with the value of `g.user`.  This example is not very
interesting because `g` is available in templates anyways, but it gives an
idea how this works.

Variables are not limited to values; a context processor can also make functions available to templates (since Python allows passing around functions):

```
@app.context_processor
def utility_processor():
    def format_price(amount, currency="€"):
        return f"{amount:.2f}{currency}"
    return dict(format_price=format_price)
```
The context processor above makes the `format_price` function available to all
templates:

```
{{ format_price(0.33) }}
```
You could also build `format_price` as a template filter (see
[Registering Filters](#registering-filters)), but this demonstrates how to pass functions in a
context processor.

## Streaming

It can be useful to not render the whole template as one complete string, instead render it as a stream, yielding smaller incremental strings. This can be used for streaming HTML in chunks to speed up initial page load, or to save memory when rendering a very large template.

The Jinja template engine supports rendering a template piece
by piece, returning an iterator of strings. Flask provides the
[ stream_template()](../api/#flask.stream_template) and 

[functions to make this easier to use.](../api/#flask.stream_template_string)

`stream_template_string()````
from flask import stream_template
@app.get("/timeline")
def timeline():
    return stream_template("timeline.html")
```
These functions automatically apply the
[ stream_with_context()](../api/#flask.stream_with_context) wrapper if a request is active, so that

`request`, `session`, and [remain available in the template.](../api/#flask.g)

`g`More headers cannot be sent after the body has begun. Therefore, you must
make sure all headers are set before starting the response. In particular,
if the template will access `session`, be sure to do so in the view as
well so that the `Vary: cookie` header will be set.
